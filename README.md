# `security.txt` - A Standard for Web Security Policies

`security.txt` is a proposed standard that allows websites to define security policies. It makes the process of security vulnerability disclosure standardized and more accessible.

## üìñ Introduction

When security researchers discover a vulnerability, they often need to find the right contact to report their findings. The `security.txt` file simplifies this process by offering a standardized method for security contact information.

This standard is based on [RFC9116](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9116/).

## üéØ Purpose

The primary goals of `security.txt` are:

- **Transparency**: Demonstrating an organization's openness to security feedback and its procedure for addressing vulnerabilities.
  
- **Ease of Reporting**: Providing a clear channel for researchers to report vulnerabilities.
  
- **Standardization**: Establishing a common practice, making vulnerability reporting more straightforward across various platforms.

## üìç Location

The `security.txt` file is typically found at the `/.well-known/` path. For instance:

```
https://example.com/.well-known/security.txt
```

For legacy systems, it might be at the root directory.

## üìù Format

Here's a basic `security.txt` structure:

```
Contact: security@example.com
Encryption: https://example.com/pgp-key.txt
Acknowledgments: https://example.com/hall-of-fame
Policy: https://example.com/security-policy
```

- **Contact**: Where vulnerabilities should be reported, typically an email or a link to a contact form.
  
- **Encryption**: A public PGP key link for encrypted communications.
  
- **Acknowledgments**: A page thanking individuals who've reported vulnerabilities.
  
- **Policy**: The organization's vulnerability disclosure policy.

## üìå Conclusion

Using a `security.txt` file is a proactive security measure. It provides researchers with a straightforward, standardized method to report vulnerabilities, contributing to a safer internet.
